		    <h2>Early life</h2>
			<li> <strong>Ferdinand </strong> (24 August 1865 – 20 July 1927), nicknamed Întregitorul ("the Unifier"), was <strong> King of Romania from 1914 until 1927</strong>. </li>
			<li>Following the renunciations, first of his father in 1880 and then of his elder brother Prince Wilhelm of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen in 1886, young Ferdinand became <strong>the heir-presumptive to the throne of his childless uncle, King Carol I of Romania</strong>.</li>
			<h2>World War I</h2>
			<li>Though a member of a cadet branch of Germany's ruling Hohenzollern imperial family, Ferdinand <strong> presided over his country's entry into World War I on the side of the Triple Entente powers </strong>against the Central Powers on 27 August 1916. Thus he gained the nickname the Loyal, respecting his oath when sworn in before the Romanian Parliament in 1914: <strong>"I will reign as a good Romanian."</strong>.</li>
			<li>As a consequence of this "betrayal" toward his German roots, Kaiser Wilhelm II had Ferdinand's name erased from the Hohenzollern House register.</li>
			<li>The outcome of Romania's war effort was <strong> the union of Bessarabia, Bukovina and Transylvania with the Kingdom of Romania in 1918</strong>. Ferdinand became the ruler of a greatly enlarged Romanian state in 1918–1920 following the Entente's victory over the Central Powers, a war between the Kingdom of Romania and the Hungarian Soviet Republic, and the civil war in Russia. He was crowned as king of <strong>"Greater Romania" </strong>in a spectacular ceremony on 15 October 1922 at the courtyard of the newly opened "Coronation Cathedral" in the historic princely seat of Alba Iulia in Transylvania. </li>
			<li>A new period of Romanian history began on the day of the Union of Transylvania with Romania (<strong>Great Union Day, Marea Unire</strong>). This period would eventually come to an end with the international treaties that led up to World War II. These ceded parts of Romania to its neighbors. As such, they are widely seen as an attempt to provoke the country into taking sides and joining the war.</li>
			<h2>Death</h2>
			<li>Ferdinand died from cancer in Sinaia in 1927, and was succeeded by his grandson <strong>Crown Prince Michael </strong>under a regency (Michael's father having renounced his rights to the throne in December 1925). The regency had three members, one of whom was Ferdinand's second son, Prince Nicholas.</li>
